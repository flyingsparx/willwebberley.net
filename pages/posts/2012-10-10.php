<p>
I gave a seminar on my current research phase. </p>
<p>
I summarised my work over the past few months; in particular, the work on the network structure of Twitter, the way in which tweets
propagate through different network types, and the implications of this. I discussed the importance of precision and recall as metrics
for determining a timeline\'s quality and how this is altered through retweeting in different network types.
</p>
<p>
I concluded by talking about my next area of research; how I may use the model used for the previous experimentation to determine if 
a tweet is particularly interesting based on its features. Essentially, this boils down to showing that tweets are siginificantly
interesting (or uninteresting) by looking at how they compare to their <i>predicted</i> retweet behaviours as produced by the model.</p>
